# ECE Survive Guide

This guide is about how to survive ECE at the University of Waterloo. Actually,
that's a lie, this guide is about how to build the survival guide from source.

You will need:

- LaTeX (specifically pdflatex)
- MetaPost (this generally comes with LaTeX)
- XFig to edit the figures
- fig2dev, part of Transfig, to generate the figures
- Make
- courage

On Ubuntu/Debian, you can `sudo apt-get install texlive xfig transfig make` and
get everything but courage.
